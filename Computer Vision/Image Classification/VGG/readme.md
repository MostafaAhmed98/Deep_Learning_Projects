## Food-101 Image Classification with VGG16 in PyTorch

This repository provides a PyTorch implementation for training a VGG16 model on the Food-101 dataset [5 classes] for image classification.

**Key Features:**

* **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Organized data structure with class folders.
    * Mini-dataset creation for specific food items.
    * Separate training and testing data augmentation.
* **VGG16 Model:**
    * VGG16 architecture with explanations.
    * Adaptable output layer for different class numbers.
* **Training and Testing:**
    * Cross-entropy loss function for multi-class classification.
    * SGD optimizer with step-based learning rate scheduler.
    * Training and testing functions with loss, accuracy tracking, and visualization.
* **Callbacks:**
    * `SaveBestModel` callback: Saves the best model based on validation loss.
    * `ValidationLossEarlyStopping` callback: Prevents overfitting by stopping training if validation loss doesn't improve.

**Additional Notes:**

* This is a basic implementation and can be further extended with features like hyperparameter tuning, visualization dashboards, and model deployment.
  
**Feel free to contribute to this project by improving the code, adding functionalities, or fixing any issues.**
